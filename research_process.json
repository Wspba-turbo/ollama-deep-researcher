The model exemplifies a balanced approach to AI advancement, combining performance, efficiency, and accessibility through its innovative techniques and focus on continuous improvement. DeepSeek R1's architecture builds upon the DeepSeek-V3-Base model, incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoE), Multihead Latent Attention (MLA), and FP8 quantization. MoE activates only a subset of parameters per token, significantly reducing computational costs. MLA reduces inference latency by projecting Key-Query-Value matrices into a lower-dimensional latent space, decreasing attention complexity. FP8 quantization reduces memory usage by 75% compared to FP32, enabling efficient training on large GPU clusters. A key innovation is Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), which allows DeepSeek-R1 to predict multiple tokens simultaneously, enhancing both training and inference efficiency. Unlike traditional autoregressive models that generate one token at a time, MTP predicts a sequence of tokens in parallel, using an autoregressive base but extending it by parallelizing token prediction within the same context window. The model samples multi-token outputs from a probabilistic distribution, re-ranking them to ensure coherence and consistency. A dynamic prediction horizon is employed, varying the number of tokens generated simultaneously based on the model's confidence. MLA plays a crucial role in MTP by enabling efficient caching and reuse of intermediate computations. The mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture further supports MTP by assigning specialized expert layers to handle different segments of token prediction. MTP reduces the number of decoding steps, leading to speedups, especially for long-text or multi-turn interactions, and excels in reasoning tasks requiring long chains of thought. The model's reasoning architecture incorporates feedback loops, allowing it to detect and adjust errors within multi-token outputs, improving coherence across generated sequences. DeepSeek-R1's training pipeline consists of two main stages: a cold start with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). The cold start involves fine-tuning the V3-Base model with high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples, curated using few-shot prompting, manual annotation, and refinement of DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs. This addresses the challenge of initializing a large language model with structured reasoning and readability, imposing a structured output format with `<reasoning_process>` and `<summary>` tags. The SFT stage uses a supervised cross-entropy loss function. Reinforcement learning is the core of DeepSeek-R1\u2019s reasoning evolution, using accuracy and format rewards. Accuracy rewards evaluate the correctness of deterministic tasks, while format rewards encourage consistent reasoning structures. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the centerpiece of DeepSeek-R1\u2019s RL framework, providing a simplified and efficient alternative to traditional policy optimization methods like PPO and DPO. GRPO uses a likelihood ratio, an advantage function, a clipping mechanism, and a KL divergence penalty. The likelihood ratio measures how much more likely the new policy is to produce an output compared to the old policy. The advantage function evaluates how much better an output is compared to the average outputs in the group. The clipping mechanism ensures that the policy updates remain stable by restricting the likelihood ratio. The KL divergence term ensures the new policy remains close to a reference policy. GRPO eliminates the need for a critic model, using group-level rewards for baseline estimation, reducing memory and computational overhead. GRPO encourages emergent behaviors such as self-reflection, enhancing general reasoning and task diversity during training. In contrast, PPO relies on an actor-critic architecture, increasing memory and computational requirements, while DPO optimizes policies based on pairwise preferences from human feedback, which can introduce inconsistencies. During training, DeepSeek-R1 developed emergent reasoning behaviors such as reflection, self-correction, and \"aha\" moments, where the model pauses and reevaluates to discover new solutions. DeepSeek-R1\u2019s reasoning capabilities were distilled into smaller models using a teacher-student paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance while retaining reasoning capabilities and outperforming larger, non-reasoning models.",

DeepSeek R1's architecture builds upon the DeepSeek-V3-Base model, incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoE), Multihead Latent Attention (MLA), and FP8 quantization. MoE activates only a subset of parameters per token, significantly reducing computational costs. MLA reduces inference latency by projecting Key-Query-Value matrices into a lower-dimensional latent space, decreasing attention complexity. FP8 quantization reduces memory usage by 75% compared to FP32, enabling efficient training on large GPU clusters. A key innovation is Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), which allows DeepSeek-R1 to predict multiple tokens simultaneously, enhancing both training and inference efficiency. Unlike traditional autoregressive models that generate one token at a time, MTP predicts a sequence of tokens in parallel, using an autoregressive base but extending it by parallelizing token prediction within the same context window. The model samples multi-token outputs from a probabilistic distribution, re-ranking them to ensure coherence and consistency. A dynamic prediction horizon is employed, varying the number of tokens generated simultaneously based on the model's confidence. MLA plays a crucial role in MTP by enabling efficient caching and reuse of intermediate computations. The mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture further supports MTP by assigning specialized expert layers to handle different segments of token prediction. MTP reduces the number of decoding steps, leading to speedups, especially for long-text or multi-turn interactions, and excels in reasoning tasks requiring long chains of thought. The model's reasoning architecture incorporates feedback loops, allowing it to detect and adjust errors within multi-token outputs, improving coherence across generated sequences. DeepSeek-R1's training pipeline consists of two main stages: a cold start with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). The cold start involves fine-tuning the V3-Base model with high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples, curated using few-shot prompting, manual annotation, and refinement of DeepSeek-R1-Zero outputs. This addresses the challenge of initializing a large language model with structured reasoning and readability, imposing a structured output format with `<reasoning_process>` and `<summary>` tags. The SFT stage uses a supervised cross-entropy loss function. Reinforcement learning is the core of DeepSeek-R1\u2019s reasoning evolution, using accuracy and format rewards. Accuracy rewards evaluate the correctness of deterministic tasks, while format rewards encourage consistent reasoning structures. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the centerpiece of DeepSeek-R1\u2019s RL framework, providing a simplified and efficient alternative to traditional policy optimization methods like PPO and DPO. GRPO uses a likelihood ratio, an advantage function, a clipping mechanism, and a KL divergence penalty. The likelihood ratio measures how much more likely the new policy is to produce an output compared to the old policy. The advantage function evaluates how much better an output is compared to the average outputs in the group. The clipping mechanism ensures that the policy updates remain stable by restricting the likelihood ratio. The KL divergence term ensures the new policy remains close to a reference policy. GRPO eliminates the need for a critic model, using group-level rewards for baseline estimation, reducing memory and computational overhead. GRPO encourages emergent behaviors such as self-reflection, enhancing general reasoning and task diversity during training. In contrast, PPO relies on an actor-critic architecture, increasing memory and computational requirements, while DPO optimizes policies based on pairwise preferences from human feedback, which can introduce inconsistencies. During training, DeepSeek-R1 developed emergent reasoning behaviors such as reflection, self-correction, and \"aha\" moments, where the model pauses and reevaluates to discover new solutions. DeepSeek-R1\u2019s reasoning capabilities were distilled into smaller models using a teacher-student paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance while retaining reasoning capabilities and outperforming larger, non-reasoning models. DeepSeek-R1's Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) is a key innovation that enhances training and inference efficiency by predicting multiple tokens per step, unlike traditional autoregressive models that generate one token at a time.

DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that reasoning capabilities can emerge from RL alone, without relying on massive supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The model's architecture integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE), Multihead Latent Attention (MLA), and FP8 quantization to optimize training and inference. MoE activates only a subset of parameters per token, significantly reducing computational costs. MLA reduces inference latency by projecting Key-Query-Value (KQV) matrices into a lower-dimensional latent space. FP8 quantization reduces memory usage by 75% compared to FP32. MTP improves inference efficiency, particularly for long-context reasoning tasks, by predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. The model uses an autoregressive base but extends it by parallelizing token prediction within the same context window. The multi-token outputs are sampled from a probabilistic distribution and re-ranked to ensure coherence and consistency. The number of tokens generated simultaneously may vary depending on the model's confidence. MLA enables efficient caching and reusing of intermediate computations, which is critical when predicting multiple tokens at once.
